In prepare_files you read KnotOut.xyz, where you find a 100points curve that evolves over 100 time steps. Visualize the knot/curve in a 3D plot. Save all 100 time steps in CSVS file using tsv.



Starting with a file txt:
1) PH notebook to extract feature and save it in a JSON file
2) visualize represetnative cycles in vis_cycles
3) get_filtration notebook to add in the JSON file the filtration
4) knot2 to compute vineyards
4.1) vis_PD to see all Persistent Diagrams
